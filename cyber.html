                <b> (2) Email-crimes -
                      --E-mail Forgery / Spoofing</b>

Email spoofing is email movement in which the sender address and different parts of the email header are adjusted to seem like the email started from an alternate source.</br>



<b>--E-mail Bombing</b>

An e-mail bomb is a form of net abuse consisting of sending huge volumes of e-mail to an address in an attempt to overflow the mailbox or overwhelm the server where the email address is hosted in a denial-of-service attack.</br>

<b>--E-mail Spamming</b>

Email Spam is flooding the internet with many copies of the same message in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted e-mail, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth.
</br>
<b>--E-mail Threats</b>

Email has become a popular tool for threatening or blackmailing someone even for some small cause like personal revenge, financial gain or just for freaking etc.</br>

<b>--Defamatory E-mail</b>

Defamation through mails is communication to third parties of false statements about a person that injure the reputation of or deter others from associating with that person. Defamation requires publication such as an email from a verified email account. This means when you are writing a defamatory statement about someone, you are authorizing publication of that email. All emails thereafter are considered a new publication and any other person who forwards or shares that email may be implicated in any resulting cases. </br> <p>
